#### CMPE Lab#3

**Requirements:**

- Use the Design Pattern Sample Code for the Observer Pattern for this problem set:
  - [https://github.com/paulnguyen/cmpe202/tree/master/labs/lab3 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.](https://github.com/paulnguyen/cmpe202/tree/master/labs/lab3)
- Debug the Observer Pattern code in BlueJ using Single-Steps Debugging in **runTest()** method of the **ObserverTest Unit Test Class.**
- Take Screenshots of the code in the debugger for each method call you capture in the Sequence Diagram.
- For each Screenshot, provide a short "one line" caption referencing the UML Sequence Message Index Number.
- Participants should be Objects (i.e. not Interfaces).  
- Objects must be represented by their runtime type (i.e. obj.getClass().getName())
- Do not show constructor calls.  I am only interested in message calls after all Participants (objects) have been instantiated

- **Astah File Should be:**  **"cmpe202/lab3/output/observer-pattern-uml.asta"**
- Screenshots for Sequence Diagrams Messages should be in the folder: "cmpe202/lab3/output"
  - **Each "Screenshot File" should correlate to a message in your Sequence Diagram via the "Message Index Number" and "Message Name".   Example file name: "1.1 - Notify Observers.png"**
